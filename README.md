# Files to Notion ([files2notion.com](https://files2notion.com/))

Organise and access your local files in Notion, without uploading them to the Cloud.

## Manage your local files and folders
Create Notion database of your local file metadata, including file name, absolute path, size or type

## Link to your local files
Open your local files directly from Notion (works for both website and desktop app)
